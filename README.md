## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating medical images using the MedMNIST dataset. The MedMNIST dataset includes various subsets of medical images, such as ChestMNIST, TissueMNIST, and more. This project aims to demonstrate how VAEs can be used to generate realistic medical images for research and educational purposes.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedMNIST-VAE.git
cd MedMNIST-VAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
  ## Training
  
To train the VAE model on the MedMNIST dataset, do the following

```python
// On train.py file line 10 Choose MedMNIST Dataset
data_flag = 'pathmnist'

```

Then on terminal run

```bash
python train.py
```

  ## Generating Images

After training VAE, run the script:

```bash
python generate.py
```

## Encoder
- Convolutional layers to extract features
- Fully connected layers to output the mean and log-variance of the latent space

## Decoder
- Fully connected layer to expand the latent space
- Transpose convolutional layers to reconstruct the image

## Results
Here are some example images generated by the VAE after training:
